# Innovations and Opportunities in Liberal Arts Computing Education

A [SIGCSE 2021](https://sigcse2021.sigcse.org) affiliated event organized by members of the SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges.

This event builds on priorities identified at our [SIGCSE 2020 Pre-Symposium event](https://computing-in-the-liberal-arts.github.io/SIGCSE2020-PreSymposium-Event/), and will cover three major topics. We will again discuss uniquely liberal arts approaches to computing curricula through presentation of selected curricula. We will explore models and best practices for “CS+X” courses, considering what the outcomes should be for such courses in order to take both disciplines into balanced consideration. We will consider models for mentoring, recruiting and hiring PhD candidates and postdocs into computer science positions at liberal arts institutions.

  - #### 1:00-2:30: Current Issues in Liberal Arts Computing Education

    The past year has led all of us to rethink and restructure our teaching in a variety of ways. The COVID-19 pandemic has most of us teaching in new and unexpected modalities, sometimes changing mid-semester. As instructors, disparities in the resources available to our students and in their personal situations have become more visible as they work to engage in our coursework or balance their education with other priorities. And increased attention on the impact of structural racism has challenged us to question our pedagogies and the underlying racism embedded in our own discipline.

    For the first hour of this session, participants will share changes that they have made in their teaching, perhaps unplanned or half-developed, that they are excited to continue and develop further, with conversation then moving into breakout rooms focused on common themes. The session will close with a discussion of what priorities the liberal arts computing community has for the coming year and how the Committee can help support their work.

  - #### 2:30-3:00: Break

  - #### 3:00-4:30: Curricular Innovations for Computing Education in the Liberal Arts

    Computing education in the context of the liberal arts presents unique challenges related to institutional and disciplinary priorities, pressures and needs. But it also affords unique opportunities. This session will examine some of those challenges and explores curricular innovations both well-developed and more preliminary for how to meet them. The session will begin with a 30-minute panel, where specific challenges and curricular solutions submitted by the community will be presented for discussion. Session participants will identify a short list of challenges to be discussed further, and will join breakout rooms for 20 minutes to better understand the challenge and gather ideas and examples of how that challenge is being or could be addressed. Breakout groups will report back to the entire group for the next 10 minutes. The final 30 minutes of the session will be an open conversation on how the Committee can facilitate ongoing collaboration among the liberal arts computing education community to address challenges and to disseminate solutions to the wider community.
